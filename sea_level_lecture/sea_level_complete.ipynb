    "solid Earth will be called the **solid surface**.  Above each point on the solid surface there may be an ocean of height $S$ and/or an ice sheet of height $I$. Within the context of post-glacial sea level it is sufficient to regard the oceans as being in a state of **hydrostatic equilibrium**, this implying that the **ocean surface** lies on an **equipotential of gravity**. We identify the ocean surface with this equipotential even where  there is no ocean.  Given these definitions, we can now state that the **sea level**, $SL$, is the distance, measured along the local vertical, between the solid surface and the ocean surface. Please note that $SL$ is \n",

A crucial point to remember about sea level is that it is the **relative distance** between the solid and ocean surfaces. It can, therefore, be changed by processes that modify one or both of these surfaces.\n",
    "\n",
    "In the reality, the ocean surface undergoes short-timescale variations due to winds and tides, and also has long-term topography associated with  ocean currents. Short-timescale variations can have quite large amplitudes (e.g. around 10 metres for tides in some locations), but in discussing sea level change it is  **mean sea level** that is of interest. The topography of the ocean surface caused by ocean currents is typically only a few centimetres in amplitude, and so negligible relative to deglacial changes of order of metres or more. For studies of modern day sea level change, however, variations in ocean currents are significant, as are **steric effects**, this meaning the expansion or contraction of the water column due to variations in  salinity and/or temperature."
