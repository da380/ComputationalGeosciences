    "Today we are going to consider how sea level changes as ice sheets melt. In doing this we will see a further application of the spherical harmonic methods developed last time, and also  consider the iterative solution of an **integral equation** that arises within sea level theory. The full deglacial sea level problem is rather complicated, but we will simplify things substantially by neglecting viscoelastic deformation within the Earth. In spite of this and some other approximations  outlined below, the resulting theory is actually still quite useful. In particular, it allows us to estimate sea level changes immediately following periods of rapid ice melt, with rapid here being relative to the Earth's viscoelastic relaxation time-scale of around 1000 years. \n",
